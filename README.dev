How to test sanlock
===================

To run the python based tests, you need pytest. The best way to install a
recent version is to use pip:

    $ pip install pytest

Before running the tests, you need to build sanlock and wdmd:

    $ make -C wdmd
    $ make -C src

To use libsanlock.so and libwdmd.so from the source tree:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD/src:$PWD/wdmd

To run the tests:

    $ pytest
